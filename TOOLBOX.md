## To Keep in Mind

Helpful tidbits from the lecture.

- A function without arguments is executed anyway if the number of arguments is different to the function definition
- In if statements: write the literal to the left of the '===' (e.g. if ( 3 === a) { ... })

e.g. for curried function using lambda expressions (brackets are optional, added here for readability):
`const doit2 = (callme => (arg => callme(arg)));`
